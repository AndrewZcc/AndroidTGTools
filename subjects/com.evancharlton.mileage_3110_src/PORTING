So you want to fork Mileage or port it to another platform? Great! Mileage is
licensed under the Apache 2.0 license, so you're free to do that. However,
I ask that you follow three simple steps:

  1) Change the icon
     I don't want users to be confused about the authenticity of the
     application, so please pick a different icon.

  2) Change the package name
     Do not leave it as com.evancharlton.mileage, and please don't
     use anything in the com.evancharlton.* namespace.

  3) Change the strings
     In particular, remove the strings which reference email
     addresses or authors. I do not want your users accidentally
     emailing me for support.

When these rules are followed, everyone wins! You get Mileage on your other
platform, your users get a consistent experience, and I don't have to deal
with confused users!

Thanks!
