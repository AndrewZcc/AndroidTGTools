    <title>New in 1.5.0.: Payment methods</title>
    <para>
      Through this new channel, I will publish regularly explanations and discussions of
      <application>My Expenses</application>'s functionality. In contrast to the tutorial, which I
      try to keep consistent with the current release, and which is translated to all supported
      languages, these articles are meant to document new features, as they arise, to generate
      comments from users and hence to contribute to the app's continuos improvement.
    </para>
    <para>
      In answer to requests voiced already by its first users, version 1.5.0. of <application>My
      Expenses</application> introduced payment methods. The functionality is equivalent to how
      payment methods work in <application>Grisbi</application>: Payment methods are linked to
      accounts through account types. When you create an account, you define its type as one of CASH,
      BANK, ASSET or LIABILITY. When you create transactions in a given account, you can then make
      use of the payment methods that are linked to its account type. 
    </para>
    <para>
      Through the "Manage payment methods" activity from the preferences screen, you can change, add
      and delete methods.

    <para>
      <application>My Expenses</application> has four predefined payment methods, all of them by
      default linked only to bank accounts: CHEQUE, CREDITCARD, DEPOSIT, DIRECTDEBIT. Those cannot
      be deleted, or renamed, but you can alter their association with account types. Clicking on a
      method or activating the <guibutton>New</guibutton> button brings you to the following screen:

        </mediaobject>
      </screenshot>
    </figure>
    <para>
      Here you decide if the method should only be used for expenses (credit), incomes (debit), or
      both (neutral). And you check the account types where you want to make use of it. Now in the
      edit screen for transactions you will see a line labeled <guilabel>Method</guilabel>, with a button opening the
      dialog where you select one of the applicable methods for the transaction.

    </figure>
    <para>
    Unfortunately, payment methods are not yet expressed in the QIF export, because the standard
    does not provide a field for this information. If you have an idea on how to export transactions
    in a more expressive format, let me know.

    <title>New feature in upcoming 1.6.0 release: Templates </title>
    <para>
      <application>My Expenses</application> now tries to help you enter recurrent transactions: say
      you often eat a fixed-priced meal in your favourite restaurant, or transfer the same amount of
      money from one account to the other, or buy the weekly magazine at your newsstand, you name it.
      After you have entered the transaction once, you call the <guilabel>Create template</guilabel> command from its context menu:

      </screenshot>
    </figure>
    <para>
      Enter a title for the template:

          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </screenshot>
    </figure>
    <para>
      Templates are available through the <guibutton>New</guibutton> 
      button's popup window. 
    </para>

          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </screenshot>
    </figure>
    <para>
      Clicking on a template's title results in the instantiation of a new transaction with all information
      (amount, category, comment, payee, payment method) from the template. Only time and date reflect
      the current moment. 
   </para>

        </mediaobject>
      </screenshot>
    </figure>
   <para>
      In the same way you can define templates for transfers. Templates are linked to
      accounts, so you only see templates defined for the current account in the popup menu.
    </para>    
    <para>
      Inspecting the list of templates and deleting the ones you no longer need, is available from
      the preferences.
