Sanity requires administrator privileges just for turning the screen off during a phone call. Without such privileges, Sanity cannot turn off screen when you put the phone close to your ear during a call.

Anyway, disabling administrator is required to uninstall Sanity.

Are you sure to deny administrator privileges to Sanity?
