Description of all methods for blocking the calls:

- Hang up: this is the usual way to reject a call, it's like you refuse a call by hand (for example by pressing the red button) while the phone is ringing.

- Interrupt the signal: this method stops the GSM antenna, then turn on it again. You can also choose a late restart, thus leaving the signal dropped for a while, you will avoid to decline again the caller (if he tries to recall you immediately).

- Silent answer: mute the audio system and automatically answer the call. In this way, the caller will not hear anything. So, it will be almost impossible the caller understands you're refusing him!
CAUTION: with this method it's very important you don't use the phone during the muted call, otherwise Android will automatically turn on the microphone!!

- Silent ringtone: put the phone in silent mode only while ringing. It's useful if you don't want to answer or reject the call: the ringtone won't annoy you.
