A profile is just a backup of all your preferences that you can quickly restore (by activating the profile). Through profiles you can change all the Sanity preferences in one fell swoop.

You can also create a shortcut in the Home screen to activate a profile on the fly (by long pressing your finger in the Home screen).

Use the menu to manage your profiles:

- New: create a new profile by choosing the name you like, the profile will contain all current preferences.

- Activate: restore all preferences of the selected profile (all current preferences will be lost).

- Save: save all current preferences to the selected profile (all previous preferences contained in the profile will be lost).

- Rename: change the name of the selected profile.

- Delete: remove the selected profile (it will be definitely lost).

- Show: display all preferences of the selected profile.

Note: a profile contains all and only the preferences at the time it is created or saved. Any subsequent changes to the preferences (taken after you have created/saved a profile) do not affect this profile.
